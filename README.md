# ☎️ Phonebook "Filter by Age" App - Next.js 13 + React 18 + Tailwind CSS + XState + CRUD Operations

# 👀 View Production Build at https://phonebook-filter-by-age.vercel.app/

This is a simple phonebook app that supports CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) and "filter by age" functionality.

The app provides a form where you can enter a name, birthday, mailing address,phone number, and email for each phonebook entry.

Below you will find the complete feature set, a discussion section, and my technical journal.

## Tech Stack

1. ✅ Next.js 13
1. ✅ React 18
1. ✅ Tailwind CSS
1. ✅ TypeScript
1. ✅ XState finite state machines
1. ✅ `localStorage` used as database
1. ✅ Vercel for deployment
1. ✅ TravisCI for CI/CD
1. ✅ Jest + React Testing Library
1. ✅ ESLint + Prettier + Husky Git Hooks

## Feature List

1. ✅ Used Next.js version 13.0.3 with React 18.2.0 and Tailwind CSS 3.2.4.
1. ✅ Deployed Next.js production build to Vercel with CI/CD at Travis CI.
1. ✅ Established engineering best practices:
   - Prettier, ESLint, Husky (Git Hooks), `tsconfig.json`, TypeScript Import Sorter, XState
1. ✅ Implemented XState finite state machine to handle application state.
1. ✅ Built accessible dialog (modal) using Headless UI and Tailwind CSS.
1. ✅ Added various tooltips that appear on hover to improve user experience.
1. ✅ Enabled CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, and RESET actions using React Hook Form.
1. ✅ Sorted data by last name for a consistent user experience in the app.
1. ✅ Matched design document with READ and filter by age range functionality.
1. ✅ Add some unit testing for the app with Jest & React Testing Library.

## Local Development

Use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for Node version management and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager:

```bash
fnm use
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Discussion Section

1. ✅ We use XState finite state machines. The benefit of XState is the finite set of states, without the need for additional testing.
2. ✅ It would be easy to connect any database without affecting the frontend by simplying replacing the `localStorage` calls in XState.
3. ✅ We don't handle phone or email validation at all, but we would probably want some type of reliable validation in production.
4. ✅ The entire codebase could use more testing, which is made easier by the large number of small, easily-testable components.
5. ✅ Like with many projects, the design document left out certain features: RESET, dialogs (modals), hover styles, and animations.
6. ✅ Because of the combination of `localStorage` with XState, we have auto-save functionality that supports refreshing the page.
7. ✅ Since the only major touch screen interaction difference is swiping, we shouldn't have much differences with desktop vs. mobile.
8. ✅ Accessibility has been baked into the app, but we might find some issues when writing tests or using the app with the keyboard.
9. ✅ I implemented 3 breakpoints: phone portrait (<640px), tablet or phone landscape (>=640px <1280px), and desktop (>1280px).
10. ✅ There are numerous improvements that could still be made to the user experience, such as a hover effect to show the contact's age.
